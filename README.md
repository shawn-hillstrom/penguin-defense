# Penguin Defense Game

## About

This project is the compilation of a two month project to create a simple, 2D arcade game. Penguin Defense is a static screen, tower defense game which pits a player against ravenous penguins trying to steal a village's fish supply. The player must build fortifications (walls and turrets) to stop the enemies from advancing. The game contains a total of three maps and two different types of fortifications.
