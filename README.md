## Controls & Cheat Codes ##

- Press space bar when prompted to advance to the next game state.
- When in the start of the game, use left and right arrow keys to switch maps.
- When in the playing state, use left click to build fortifications, and right click to destroy them (you will receive a fraction of the cost of the fortification back when destroying it).
- Also when in the playing state, press tab to toggle debugging information for Dijkstra's.

## Low Bar Check-List ##

- Dijkstra's Algorithm **[COMPLETE]**
- Maps & Waves **[COMPLETE]**
- Entities **[COMPLETE]**
- Animations (Simple) **[COMPLETE]** Note: This requirement was adjusted along the way, as per an email sent to Scott Wallace.
- Sound (Simple) **[COMPLETE]** Note: This requirement was adjusted along the way, as per an email sent to Scott Wallace.
- Labels **[PARTIAL]** Note: Labels were, for the most part completed; however, I did not get around to creating a label displaying the cost of different fortifications when one hovers over a tile.

## High Bar Items ##

Unfortunately, I did not have time to implement any high bar items.
